			<h1>History</h1>

			<p>The university opened its doors on October 1, 1925 as College of Commerce (<em>Wyższe Studium Handlowe</em>).</p>

			<p>In 1939 the Nazis arrested several academy professors who later were executed or sent to concentration camps. Two buildings of the school were seized, and numerous library books and documents were lost. Classes continued surreptitiously throughout the war, until the school was able to reopen in 1945. The school was nationalized in 1950 and renamed as Higher School of Economics (<em>Wyższa Szkoła Ekonomiczna</em>).</p>

			<p>In 1974 it was renamed again, as Kraków Academy of Economics (<em>Akademia Ekonomiczna w Krakowie</em>). In 2007 it received its current name: Kraków University of Economics (<em>Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Krakowie</em>).</p>
